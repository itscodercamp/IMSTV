# Project Documentation: Trusted Vehicles - Dealership Management System

## 1. Project Overview

**Trusted Vehicles** is a comprehensive, web-based Dealership Management System (DMS) designed to streamline and automate the core operations of a vehicle dealership. Built with modern technologies like Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS, it provides a robust, user-friendly platform for managing inventory, employees, and customer leads.

The system features distinct, secure portals for three types of users: **System Administrators**, **Dealership Owners/Managers**, and **Dealership Employees**, ensuring that each user has access only to the tools and information relevant to their role.

## 2. What is the Purpose of This Project?

The primary goal of the **Trusted Vehicles DMS** is to centralize and simplify the complex day-to-day activities of a car dealership. It aims to:

*   **Improve Efficiency**: By automating inventory tracking, lead management, and employee administration, it reduces manual work and minimizes errors.
*   **Enhance Decision Making**: Provides dealership owners with a clear, real-time dashboard of key metrics like stock value, sales performance, and profitability.
*   **Boost Sales Performance**: Empowers the sales team with a dedicated portal to manage customer leads effectively, from initial contact to final conversion.
*   **Provide Secure Access**: Ensures data security and integrity by providing role-based access control.
